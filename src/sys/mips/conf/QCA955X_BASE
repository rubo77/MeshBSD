# QCA955X_BASE -- Kernel configuration base file for the Qualcomm Atheros
# QCA955x SoC.
#
# This file (and the hints file accompanying it) are not designed to be
# used by themselves. Instead, users of this file should create a kernel
# config file which includes this file (which gets the basic hints), then
# override the default options (adding devices as needed) and adding
# hints as needed (for example, the GPIO and LAN PHY.)
